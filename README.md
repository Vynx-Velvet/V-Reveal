# **V-Reveal**

## Introduction 🚀
Welcome to **V-Reveal**, your solution to the controversial decision by the Riot to obscure teammate names in their competitive solo/duo mode. As a seasoned player with nearly 12 years of dedication to the game(With a name/OTP that is either praised or hated throughout NA SoloQ), I crafted this program out of sheer frustration with the negative impact this change has had on our gaming experience.

## Purpose 🌟
This program is your ticket to reinstating the vital visibility of teammate names, empowering players like you with the critical information needed to craft winning strategies and foster healthier gameplay dynamics.

## Why Protest? 🛑
The decision to cloak teammate identities has plunged our gaming community into a whirlwind of toxicity, fueling disruptive behavior and sabotaging teamwork. We firmly believe that transparency in competitive play is not just desirable but essential for cultivating fair and positive interactions among players.

## Proposed Solution 🏆
Our solution? A compromise that preserves the game's integrity while elevating the player experience. We propose keeping teammate names hidden in casual matches or modes with pre-formed teams, while illuminating them in competitive solo/duo ladder matches. This approach not only safeguards the essence of the game but also infuses it with a renewed spirit of cooperation, sportsmanship, and mutual respect.

## How to Use 🛠️
